Dude starts thin, eats things and gets fatter
Control with 1 button to jump and arrows
Getting hit reduces fatness, being hit an min fatness results in death
Being thin means you can get through small (vertical) gaps
Jumping on enemy kills it
At maximum fatness you can swallow an enemy
	- What can you do with this besides throwing them off a cliff?
		- Maybe that enemy is unkillable otherwise
	- How do you swallow? Shouldn't need a 2nd button
In the environment:
	- Food (just touch to eat)
	- Enemies
		- Simple
		- Infinite spawning (out of a pipe?)
		- ? Unkillable except by being swallowed and thrown off a cliff
		- ? Bosses
	- Spikes
	- Food pump: reusable, takes you to max fatness
